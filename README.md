# AlgoViz

AlgoViz is a web app for visualizing various algorithms. It is built using Next.js and TailwindCSS. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more algorithms in the future.

## Technologies used

- Next.js
- Redux
- TailwindCSS

## Features

- Sorting Visualizer
- Searching Visualizer
- Pathfinding Visualizer
- Minimum Spanning Tree Visualizer
- Shortest Path Visualizer
- Tower of Hanoi Visualizer
- Minimax Algorithm Visualizer
- **AI & Machine Learning Visualizers** ✨ NEW!
  - Linear Regression (with interactive gradient descent)
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (coming soon)
  - K-Means Clustering (coming soon)
  - Perceptron/Neural Networks (coming soon)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/54nd339/algoviz.git
```
2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run the app in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. For production build
```bash
npm run build
```
5. For production start
```bash
npm run start
```

## To-do
